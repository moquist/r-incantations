# r-incantations

This is a loose and currently undocumented collection of code bits written while
reading [Data-Driven Security, by Jacobs and
Rudis](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Driven-Security-Analysis-Visualization-Dashboards/dp/1118793722).

The book uses R and the Pandas Python library, and I want to learn to use
Incanter in parallel.

This is currently incomplete, because I'm only in chapter 4.

Hopefully, someday, I'll have a chance to finish this (whatever that means!),
clean it all up, and add some documentation.
