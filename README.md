# r-incantations

# BEWARE: user.clj #
Some people don't like the presence of a user.clj. If you're one of those people, you know what I mean. if you're not, then don't worry about it and carry on. ;)

## What is this thing? ##
This is a loose and currently undocumented collection of code bits written while
reading [Data-Driven Security, by Jacobs and
Rudis](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Driven-Security-Analysis-Visualization-Dashboards/dp/1118793722).

## Do I need to download stuff from the book to make this code work at all? ##
Various bits of this code currently assume you have downloaded the
code and data files for the book and placed them in this repo's top
directory under book-data. If you've got /bin/sh, curl, and unzip (or
you aren't sure but want to try it anyhow), you can execute the
'''get-book-data.sh''' script to do this automatically.

Generally speaking, on Linux or Mac OSX you should be able to do this:
```shell
sh get-book-data.sh
```

## General comments ##
The book uses R and the Pandas Python library, and I want to learn to use
the Clojure Incanter library in parallel.

This is currently incomplete, because.

Hopefully, someday, I'll have a chance to finish this (whatever that means!),
clean it all up, and add some mo/better documentation.

## Tips ##
I found it useful to have r-incantations code/REPL open in one terminal, and the
following files from the [Incanter repo](https://github.com/incanter/incanter)
open in another (so I could easily toggle back and forth):

1. modules/incanter-charts/src/incanter/charts.clj
1. modules/incanter-core/src/incanter/stats.clj
1. modules/incanter-core/src/incanter/core.clj
